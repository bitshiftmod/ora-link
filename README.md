# Orange Link

Orange Link is a decentralized, open-source link shortener built on Algorand. Users can create short links for URLs using generated and custom short codes.

## Creating Shortcodes

Users can log into the application using their Algorand account and create short codes for URLs. There are two options:

1. Generated Shortcodes
2. Custom Shortcodes

Generated shortcodes are 8 characters in length and are generated by the application. Custom shortcodes can be created at a premium price of 1 ORA.

### Cost

Generated Links: MBR Fee + standard Algo transaction fee (.001 Algo)

Custom Links: 1 ORA + MBR fee + standard Algo transaction fee (.001 Algo)


### Minimum Balance Required (MBR)

MBR (Minimum Balance Required) is a fee paid to the dApp to cover the cost of box storage for the short code and URL. The fee is equal to 2500 + 400 * (url.length + shortCode.length + 4) microAlgos, where url.length is the length of the original URL, shortCode.length is the length of the generated or custom shortcode, and 4 are the extra bytes used for headers for arc4 Strings.


## Using Shortcodes

Short codes can be resolved to the original URL anywhere the dApp page is loaded, providing trustless, long-term usability of the system. Anyone can deploy this page and the page can resolve the short code to the original URL. The shareable link includes:

```
URL of deployed page + # + shortcode
```
